Description: CellScape facilitates interactive browsing of single cell clonal evolution datasets. The tool requires two main inputs: (i) the genomic content of each single cell in the form of either copy number segments or targeted mutation values, and (ii) a single cell phylogeny. Phylogenetic formats can vary from dendrogram-like phylogenies with leaf nodes to evolutionary model-derived phylogenies with observed or latent internal nodes. The CellScape phylogeny is flexibly input as a table of source-target edges to support arbitrary representations, where each node may or may not have associated genomic data. The output of CellScape is an interactive interface displaying a single cell phylogeny and a cell-by-locus genomic heatmap representing the mutation status in each cell for each locus.
